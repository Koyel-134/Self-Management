        <p>Problem Solving</p><br>
        <p>Problem solving is the way by which solutions are developed to remove an obstacle from achieving an ultimate goal. Problems in need of solutions range from basic personal issues of "how do I turn on this appliance?' to more complex topics in the business and academic fields. The former scenario falls into the category of simple problem solving (SPS), whereas the latter is known as complex problem solving (CPS). Simple problems have one issue, while complex problems have multiple obstacles that simultaneously need solutions. [1] Obstacles are not easily removed when there is a lack of necessary resources or knowledge to attain the goal. Micro and macro problems arise constantly and therefore, problem solving is a vital part of life. Not everyone can solve a problem on their own. Lawyers, doctors, and consultants are examples of those that take on the role of being problem solvers. Many businesses have been extremely successful by recognizing a problem and creating a solution. The more people that are inconvenienced by a problem, the greater the opportunity to develop a solution.</p>
