        <p>Team Work</p><br>
        <p> Teamwork is a skill that you can develop through regular practice. It refers to your ability to work well with others to achieve a common goal. A team player will always prioritise the goals of their team over individual interests. This soft skill allows you to work as a team during conversations, professional collaborations and meetings. In fact, teamwork is one of the most sought-after skills for almost every profession. That is why employers often look for keywords like "team player" or "teamwork" on a candidate's resume.</p>
