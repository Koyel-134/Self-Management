        <p>Positive Thinking</p><br>
        <p>Positive thinking, or an optimistic attitude, is the practice of focusing on the good in any given situation. It can have a big impact on your physical and mental health.

            That doesnâ€™t mean you ignore reality or make light of problems. It simply means you approach the good and the bad in life with the expectation that things will go well.</p>
