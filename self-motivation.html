        <p>Self Motivation</p><br>
        <p>Self motivation is the ability to drive oneself to take initiative and action to pursue goals and complete tasks. It's an inner drive to take action â€” to create and to achieve. It's what pushes you to keep going on tasks, especially those you're pursuing because you want to, not because someone told you to.</p>
